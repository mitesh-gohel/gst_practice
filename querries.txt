--> What is difference between g_error() and g_printerr() ?
--> Whar is difference between g_print() and printf() ?
--> What is static pad ?
	My understanding :
		There are 3 types of pad availability : Always, Sometimes, On request. 
		Always --> pad is always available
		Sometimes --> pad will be created run time (dynamically) based on media streams. Ex. source pads of demuxer
		On request --> pad will be created based on request only. EX. source pad of tee,  sink pads of muxer
--> What is "ANY" and "empty" capabilities ?
	Ans :
		"ANY" --> The input Pad Caps of filesink are ANY, meaning that it can accept any kind of media.
--> How to debug negotiation error ?
--> What is difference between finding meda data through action signal and through GstDiscovrer
	Ans :
		in action signal --> need to play media
		in GstDiscoverer --> Without playing media, we can find meta data
		GstDiscoverer is plag-in based utility
--> What is difference between signal and action signal ?
--> What is difference between action siganl and GstQuery mechanisum of data collection ?
--> Explain Gstreamer thread.

--> Difference between codec and encoder.
--> What is container format ?
--> Explain below :

--> What is metroska container ?
--> What is plugin-good, plugin-bad etc...
--> What is %u ?
SRC template: 'video_%u'
--> What is meaning of video/x-raw ?
--> What is difference between decorder and converter ?
	My understanding :
		Decoder convert media from compressed format to raw format.
		Converter convert raw media from one raw format to another raw format.
--> What is major difference between READY and PAUSED state of pipeline ?
	Ans :
		NULL : Deactivated, element occupies no resources
		READY : Check and allocate resources
		PAUSED : It processes media. It gets a buffer to each sink. But it doesn't render media.
		PLAYING ; active dataflow. It is similar to PAUSED state, Only difference is PLAYING state plays media.
--> What are YUV formats ans RGB formats ? Explain.
--> Understand PCM in audio.
--> What is RTP ?
	Ans :
		RTP is Real-time Transport Protocol. It is used for delivering audio and video over IP network.
--> What is Event in gstreamer ?
